                <h3>Economics</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Do you truly understand the company's unit economics? In what increments does growth occur, and what can the company do to influence that?</li>
                    <li>Does the company understand its unit economics? How confident are they, and how correctly so, in their understanding of which parts of the business have operating leverage?</li>
                    <li>What are the most important complements to what the company sells? Are they getting more or less abundant?</li>
                    <li>What are some of the feedback loops in the business and in its ecosystem? Are these moving in the right direction, and what accelerates or perturbs them?</li>
                    <li>Are there other companies that are in a structurally better position to pay more for whatever the company's most important input is?</li>
                    <li>On what axes do customers evaluate this company's products compared to others? If there's meaningful differentiation, is there at least some set of customers for whom the company is the best option?</li>
                    <li>How are the economics of substitute goods changing?</li>
                    <li>What external shocks is this company unavoidably tied to?</li>
                    <li>Which parts of the business will get more efficient with scale? Which parts will get less efficient? And what's the magnitude on each side?</li>
                    <li>Is it genuinely positive-sum for the world if this company grows in market share?</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Incentives</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>How much of the company does management own?</li>
                    <li>Within that ownership, what do their incentives look like?</li>
                    <li>How hard is it for employees to get promoted?</li>
                    <li>How hard is it for them to get fired?</li>
                    <li>Has a co-founder stepped down (for early-stage companies); has a senior executive quit (for mature ones)? Did they have a really good reason?</li>
                    <li>Do management incentives align with shareholder incentives with respect to acquisitions?</li>
                    <li>Are incentives aligned in terms of capital retention versus capital returns?</li>
                    <li>Are incentives aligned in terms of risk level?</li>
                    <li>Do incentives for employees who don't show up in the proxy statement match incentives for the ones who do?</li>
                    <li>If the company succeeds, does everyone—employees, managers, founders, investors, suppliers, customers—get about what they deserve?</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Competitors</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>What's the total addressable market, and what do steady-state margins look like if the company captures a meaningful share of that market?</li>
                    <li>If you take all the companies targeting that market, and add up the market share they all intend to capture, how big is the number?</li>
                    <li>If that number is above 100%, why is this one the winner?</li>
                    <li>If the number is below 100%, are you certain you've defined the market correctly?</li>
                    <li>Where is the company a price-setter and where is it a price-taker?</li>
                    <li>How good is your target company's conspiracy to make themselves a price-setter compared to everyone else?</li>
                    <li>Comparing the company to its most dangerous competitor, which strategic differences are deliberate and which result from path-dependence?</li>
                    <li>Are there any companies that aren't competitors, but are pretending to be for fundraising purposes? Or vice-versa?</li>
                    <li>Which competitor are you and the company most worried about? If it's not the same one, why not?</li>
                    <li>If it is the same one, why aren't you investing in them instead?</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Internals</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>What do people on Glassdoor say?</li>
                    <li>Are there suspicious strings of five-star reviews, all posted within a few days of each other?</li>
                    <li>What are employee perks like?</li>
                    <li>Does information cleanly travel between the lowest-level workers and the top?</li>
                    <li>How do they motivate people in jobs that aren't as high-status as the core role?</li>
                    <li>What's the career path at the company, at least for people joining in the highest-impact roles?</li>
                    <li>What kinds of investments does the company make in internal operations?</li>
                    <li>For small companies, what other companies have the largest internal alumni group? For bigger companies, what smaller competitor are they losing the most good people to?</li>
                    <li>If the company has had layoffs, did it do them effectively?</li>
                    <li>Does the company have an organizational structure appropriate to its current size and its ambitions?</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>External Cash</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Does the company raise money through some instrument other than what you're buying?</li>
                    <li>Does the company raise money at opportunistic times?</li>
                    <li>How effective is the company at investor relations?</li>
                    <li>If it's a capital-light business, does it have good reasons for needing money at times when it's raising money?</li>
                    <li>If it's a capital-intensive business, is the capital structure appropriately matched?</li>
                    <li>How upfront is management about bad news?</li>
                    <li>Have the company's reported metrics changed for good reasons?</li>
                    <li>How do outside investors feel about the company, and how have those investors' views changed over time?</li>
                    <li>How has the population of investors who consider the company investable changed over time, and what drives that?</li>
                    <li>An investment is partly an ongoing negotiation between investors and founders/employees over how to split the profits of the business. Who has more leverage, and how is that changing?</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Internal Cash</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>What does the company's cash cycle look like, and how is it changing?</li>
                    <li>If the company were to accelerate growth, what's the effect on cash the instant they put that plan into effect? And what about year 1, year 2, year N?</li>
                    <li>What does employee stock ownership look like compared to companies with a similar return on capital profile and age?</li>
                    <li>What does effective employee stock ownership look like when you account for their bargaining power?</li>
                    <li>If the company is burning money now, is there a plausible path to breakeven without raising more money?</li>
                    <li>What parts of the business will require larger and more unpredictable check sizes over time?</li>
                    <li>Does the company own anything valuable that isn't strictly strategic that could be converted into cash?</li>
                    <li>Are there ways for the business to shift some of its capital needs to suppliers and customers over time?</li>
                    <li>How lumpy are cash flows, and is the company structured to handle this?</li>
                    <li>What cash return would a private investor who bought the company expect to achieve without the company being taken public, and when does that return actually show up?</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Valuation</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>If you put together a discounted cash flow valuation for the business, which of the assumptions require the most guesswork, and what collapses that uncertainty?</li>
                    <li>If you didn't use a discounted cash flow model, what metric would you evaluate the company on and who would you compare it to?</li>
                    <li>For public companies, how have valuations in this sector varied over time, and why?</li>
                    <li>How does the slice of the capital structure you're investing in respond to volatility?</li>
                    <li>Suppose this year your portfolio has its worst return in a decade. Is this company a relative positive or negative contributor?</li>
                    <li>Can you trust the numbers? And is management pointing you to numbers that are easier to fudge?</li>
                    <li>What valuation does the company get at a more mature stage of its existence? And how soon will it get there?</li>
                    <li>Which metrics will matter more at that maturity, and when will the company focus on them?</li>
                    <li>Is the fundamental bet that the company is being misvalued relative to peers, that it and its peers all trade at the wrong valuation, or that it has no valuation peers at all?</li>
                    <li>Does this investment force you to take risks you're not being well-compensated for?</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Timing</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Would you have had the same thesis six months ago? What has the price done since then?</li>
                    <li>How long do you intend to hold, and what could change that?</li>
                    <li>What's the timing gap between the certainties and uncertainties in the business, and how does this change over time?</li>
                    <li>In your discounted cash flow model, when do cash flows turn positive, and what's the duration?</li>
                    <li>Is there a future catalyst that will make the valuation more certain?</li>
                    <li>Is there a future catalyst that will make your valuation relatively more certain than everyone else's?</li>
                    <li>If there's going to be a future opportunity to invest in the company, will you actually have the opportunity to do so?</li>
                    <li>If you think of equity as an option on the value of the company's assets, what is the cost of time decay and are you comfortable paying it?</li>
                    <li>Is there a relatively better investment right now, such that this one can wait?</li>
                    <li>Does this idea get better or worse with time?</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Psychology</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>How would you feel if you couldn't get a quote for a month/quarter/year?</li>
                    <li>Suppose it's a year from now and you've lost half of (or all) of your money. What's the most likely thing that went wrong?</li>
                    <li>Suppose it's five years from now and you've earned less from this investment than you would have gotten from t-bills. What did you get wrong?</li>
                    <li>What's most likely to make you exit the position too early if you're ultimately right? And what can you do about that?</li>
                    <li>How long can this company underperform comparable companies before you'd be convinced you were wrong?</li>
                    <li>Does this closely pattern-match to an impressive trade by someone you respect?</li>
                    <li>How much does this trade invert a big mistake you've made?</li>
                    <li>Is this investment going to be a larger share of your time than it is of your portfolio? And, if so, is it worth it?</li>
                    <li>If you are right, people besides you will also do well. Are you comfortable with this?</li>
                    <li>As the venerable-for-a-reason saying goes, "Do you want to be right or do you want to make money?"</li>
