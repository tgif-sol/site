<p class="intro-text">Five prompts, ranked by impact (easy first), to review by yourself, your family, your team, etc. These prompts sit alongside goal review and planning.</p>

                <h3>Historian</h3>
                <p>Ten years from now, you look back at this year, what's the headline? What's the story of the year?</p>

                <h3>Consultant</h3>
                <p>What were your three biggest accomplishments, challenges, and failures across personal, relationship, and professional domains. Make a 3x3 diagram and have some fun. These grids serve as great visuals in the future when you're wondering "what the hell happened in 2016 again?"</p>

                <h3>Therapist</h3>
                <p>What behaviors, habits, people, situations, etc held you back? Where did you feel most alive? Be specific.</p>

                <h3>Coach</h3>
                <p>What feedback have you received, and how have you acted upon it? Be specific.</p>

                <h3>Self</h3>
                <p>Write yourself an email outlining your goals, thoughts, and intentions for the year and have it auto-sent for exactly one year into the future</p>

                <p>And one extra-credit exercise that's <em>really hard,</em> but very effective. The Eulogy. Write your own eulogy! Imagine at least three speakers across family, friends, etc. What do they say about you?</p>

<p><strong>Asset class lifecycle:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Organized in a "system of record"</li>
                    <li>Valued</li>
                    <li>Financialized (traded, insured, bundled, etc)</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Some asset classes, like crypto, speed run this process because they are already organized, literally on a ledger, and have built in pricing / valuation, so it's easy to become highly financialized. Some asset classes take decades to develop. So where is the best place to invest or build?</p>

                <p><strong>1. Build the system of record "picks and shovels" business</strong></p>
                <p>For example, Zillow for Real Estate, CME for Commodities, CBOE for Derivatives, Carta for startup stock, etc. These are all effectively vertically integrated software businesses that have built a monopoly.</p>

                <p><strong>2. Get really good at valuation</strong></p>
                <p>Either as a service provider doing the spreadsheets, or as a professional investor arbitraging valuation insight and buying the asset directly. Basically, Deloitte or Berkshire are the two ends of the continuum for this one.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Create new financialization in an established asset class</strong></p>
                <p>There are only a few options here:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make it easier to trade the asset</li>
                    <li>Make a derivative or a structured products of the asset</li>
                    <li>Lend / borrow against the asset AKA securitization</li>
                    <li>Insure / hedge the asset</li>
                </ul>

                <p>So that means, with any asset class there are really only SEVEN total options. Each asset class can be broken down, based on maturity, to better assess where in the value chain to invest or build.</p>

                <p><strong>Some hypotheses I'd like to test / backtest:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>SoR businesses are wildly undervalued in the first decade-ish of their rise</li>
                    <li>You should NOT ever buy assets directly unless you have a material edge</li>
                    <li>Investing in the leading service businesses doing valuation offer the best risk-adjusted returns</li>
                    <li>Investing in the emerging fund managers targeting the asset class offers the next best risk-adjusted return</li>
                    <li>Building or investing at the financialized level is the hardest and most competitive, but most lucrative</li>
                </ul>

<p>A Business Operating System (BOS) is a <em>comprehensive</em> framework that integrates the core processes, tools, principles, and methodologies necessary for an organization to plan, execute, monitor, and improve its operations. A "good" BOS boils down to three ideas: goals, metrics, and continuous improvement.</p>
                <p>So what BOS should we / you use? Well, it's a long story. We'll skip Sumerians and record keeping, Renaissance and scientific method, Adam Smith and division of labor, industrial revolution and factories, and instead - jump right in with who I think are the Big Three (Deming, Ohno, and Wickman) to study.</p>

                <p>Getting this list down to three was hard! While early pioneers of scientific management, like Frederick Taylor, are useful to read and understand, the ideas are really just foundational.</p>
                <p>Then there are dozens of quasi-systems (Balanced Scorecard, Six Sigma) that are just riffs off TPS. I'm also excluding great "private label brands" of BOS like Danaher Business System or Amazon's operating system because getting access to them is inconsistent and the operating systems are constantly updating.</p>
                <p>Gino Wickman and EOS is the only <em>publicly available</em> BOS that incorporates every useful tool (OKRs, theory of constraints, etc) of the last century. EOS is the fastest, easiest, lowest cost operating system available on the market. If you study one BOS, pick this one, because it aggregates <em>everything.</em></p>

<p>Families don't run like organizations. They should.</p>
                <p>When assessing a business, it's easy to weigh and measure it's "organizational health." Just take a look at things like values, financial statements, growth rates, employee retention, etc.</p>
                <p>Why can't these rigorous frameworks be applied to families?</p>
                <p>Answer: laziness, incompetence, training, etc. It's a long list.</p>
                <p>What's the Minimum Effective Dose of structure a family could implement in their lives?</p>
                <p>1. Values</p>
                <p>2. Objectives</p>
                <p>3. Weekly meeting and scorecard to review progress against objectives</p>
                <p>I think that's it. Those three things. Just do those three.</p>
                <p>Now, if a family wanted to take organizational theory further, they could hire a professional integrator to hold them accountable, consider brand identity (why doesn't anyone have crests anymore?!)…</p>

<p>There are four types of growth strategies. Mix and match if you'd like. Generally, in my experience, these tend to align with founder's strengths and reflect company culture.</p>
            <p>1. Marketing Lead Growth - casting a net. Think about funnels, conversion, and building a content engine. You can run MLG with all kinds of marketing - product, event, brand, social media, content, digital, influencer, partner, etc.</p>
            <p>2. Sales Lead Growth - spearfishing. Think about relationship building, intent, and building a useful CRM. With SLG, contact values need to be high to justify the time and headcount hunting down customers.</p>
            <p>3. Product Lead Growth - users refer users. Think about flywheels, network effects, and referral mechanisms. This is the most coveted and explosive form of growth and provides a strong foundation to build MLG, PLG, and CLG machines.</p>
            <p>4. Community Lead Growth - community refers users. Think about events, community managers, and running a Slack / Discord. This is the newest and least explored growth strategy, but perhaps the most "category-defining" way to grow.</p>

<h2>Leadership vs Management</h2>
            <p> 1. Leadership is doing the right thing, management is doing things right 
            <p> 2. Leadership is the UX of the company, management is the UI
            <p> 3. Leadership is creating simplicity, management is managing complexity
            <p> 4. Leadership is about vision, management is about process 
            <p> 5. Leaders are culture architects, managers are culture operators.</p>

            <h2>Leadership vs CEO</h2>
            <p>For years, I’ve been repeating the same things about the job of the CEO:</p>
            <p>1. Set the vision and communicate the hell out of it</p>
            <p>2. Get the right people on the bus and hold them accountable</p>
            <p>3. Don’t run out of money</p>
            <p>It sounds nice, doesn’t it? Definitely holds up…I mean I’ve literally said it 100x over the last decade. But, is it the job of a Leader? I don’t think so. In fact, I actually don’t think most CEOs I know are actually good Leaders. To put it bluntly - you can be an excellent CEO and a terrible Leader.</p>
            <p>I’m still working through the definition, but I think Leadership is something like:</p>
            <p>1. Tell the truth</p>
            <p>2. Simplify</p>
            <p>3. Don’t run out of trust</p>
            <p>Let’s take them one at a time.</p>
            <p>First, the struggle of being a CEO and telling the truth. Sharing a reality-distorting vision isn’t usually true, per se. It’s mostly just directional. Then CEOs get praised, raise money, close candidates while bending the truth and all of a sudden, they’re believing their own bullshit and lose track of what’s true in light of what could be true.</p>
            <p>The bigger the gap between what a CEO says externally and what’s actually happening internally - let’s call it the Vision Gap - that’s the failure mode. The bigger the Vision Gap the more trust is lost, the more trust is lost, the worse the culture, the worse the culture, the worse the performance, and it spirals from there.</p>
            <p>So why not just tell the truth? Well, first off, because for most CEOs the answer would be “<em>I think this is the best way to make money.</em>” Second, because everyone - the media, candidates, investors, etc - everyone wants them to tell a story. A story about a Noble Mission.</p>
            <p>No one wants to hear the CEO say, “<em>look this company is a trade for me, I own the majority of the company and I try everyday to figure out how to sell it or get to a liquidity event for myself!</em>” But this is the truth for 90%+ of CEOs I’ve met. Sample size is something in the thousands…</p>
            <p>Ok so that’s the tradeoff between vision and truth telling. Let’s tackle the second one - hiring vs simplification. A CEO loves to hire and “grow headcount” because it’s correlated with growth, success, and it feeds the ego. “<em>Look at all these people that want to work for me</em>!” or even worse “<em>If we can hire more people then we can do more MORE THINGS!</em>” Meanwhile, Leaders know that more people = more problems and try to fight entropy / complexity at every turn.</p>
            <p>Last difference. Hang in there. A CEO thinks about money as the fuel for their organization whereas a Leader thinks about trust as the fuel. I’m not going to get stuck in Capitalism vs Ethics, but boy, this tradeoff is perhaps the most stark. Most CEOs are forced to play Finite Games - get to the next milestone, the next quarter, the IPO, etc. Meanwhile, Leaders are focused on the people in the organization and building and maintaining trust. An infinite game.</p>

<p>Goals are broad, overarching aspirations. They inspire action.</p>
            <p>Objectives are specific, measurable steps to achieve those goals. They guide action.</p>
            <p>KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) are metrics that track progress towards goals. They measure action.</p>
            <p>Metrics are everything else that you track along the way.</p>
            <p>Here’s where is gets confusing. OKR. MBO. MBR. BSC. 4DX. Yes, these are all real acronyms. They are all different <em>planning tools.</em> OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) is the most popular because it had the best GTM strategy (Google), influencer marketing (John Doerr), and it’s sufficiently vague on implementation details so “<em>everyone kind of thinks they know how to do it</em>.” If you want a real system, check out <a href="Business%20Operating%20Systems%202572ef07198a8189aa05e47633fa25ea.md" class="external-link">Business Operating Systems</a>.</p>
            <p>These tools all make people default to thinking about <em>outputs</em> instead of <em>inputs.</em> You can track outputs in your goals and in your metrics, so don’t do it with your objectives and KPIs! Tracking and understanding <em>outputs by inputs</em> is really the point of a business or system. You want to understand exactly <em>how</em> you can make more money, NOT just tracking how much more you made. The score takes care of itself. This is the basis of Amazon’s Weekly Business Review, Elon’s algorithm, Ohno’s Toyota Production System, Netflix’s A/B tests, P&G’s focus groups, Bill Walsh’s Standards of Performance, and every other effective system I’ve seen scale.</p>
            <p>So how do you put this into practice? It seems organizations default between binary modes of “<em>we don’t track anything</em>” or “<em>we are trying to track everything.</em>” The good news is there’s likely only a handful of metrics that matter…which we’d call KPIs!! So, find your KPIs, make sure they’re <em>mostly</em> inputs not outputs, and call it a day.</p>
            <p>There are really only three categories to pick from:</p>
            <p>1. Growth: Do more X (calls, tweets, leads, etc.)</p>
            <p>2. Quality: Measure how X is going (bugs, test coverage, customer satisfaction, etc.)</p>
            <p>3. Capacity: Do X faster (automation, hiring, cycle time, etc.)</p>

<p>There are five types of therapy</p>
            <p><strong>Psychodynamic</strong></p>
            <p>Freud / Jung / Adler, Europe, in the early 1900s, “you are a function of your unconscious,” example is Psychoanalysis</p>
            <p><strong>Behavioral</strong></p>
            <p>Pavlov / Watson / Skinner, America in the 1950s, “you are a function of your stimuli / environment,” example is systematic desensitization</p>
            <p><strong>Cognitive</strong></p>
            <p>Beck / Ellis, America in the 1960s, “you are a function of your thoughts,” example is CBT (cognitive behavior therapy)</p>
            <p><strong>Humanistic</strong></p>
            <p>Maslow / Rogers, America in the 1960s, “you are a function of who you want to be,” examples are EFT (emotionally focused therapy)</p>
            <p><strong>Holistic</strong></p>
            <p>Catch all for everything else, “you are a function of everything,” examples are EMDR (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing)</p>
            <p>Like every industry (and religion) there are strong proponents of each of the Big Five systems here. It is REALLY hard to tell what system is real, or good, or even if the practitioner know what they’re doing.</p>
            <p>Some types of therapy, like CBT, are well suited to treat symptoms because they are heavily focused on tactics. On other hand, some types of therapy are focused on treating the root cause, like IFS. Then there are systems like Dialectical Behavior Therapy, which sample a little bit of everything (cognitive, buddhism, mindfulness).</p>

<p><strong>To tell someone the Truth you must:</strong></p>
            <p>1. Be accurate and not withhold information</p>

            <p><strong>To tell someone the Truth and have them hear it you must:</strong></p>
            <p>1. Attune</p>
            <p>2. Provide context</p>
            <p>3. Be accurate and not withhold information</p>

            <p><strong>To tell someone the Truth, have them hear it, and have them act on it you must:</strong></p>
            <p>1. Have trust</p>
            <p>2. Attune</p>
            <p>3. Provide context</p>
            <p>4. Be accurate and not withhold information</p>
            <p>5. Support integration of the Truth</p>

            <p><strong>In other words, unless you can deliver the Truth with ethos (credibility / trust), pathos (emotional connection / attunement), and logos (logical argument / accuracy) it's not going to go over well. To do this, first you have to have the courage to be disliked. Second, you have to actually tell the Truth, and say the things that are not being said. Third, you have to do it:</strong></p>
            <p>1. Using Non-Violent Communication</p>
            <p>2. Practicing Active Listening</p>
            <p>3. Being 100% Present</p>

            <p>You cannot be a real Truth Teller without first becoming an excellent, compassionate communicator. Ironically, you can become a world-class communicator and NOT a Truth Teller. The combination of communication and Truth Telling IS Leadership.</p>

            <p>For people who work with me, this “User Manual” is a guide to better collaboration and outcomes. It’s a living document and if you’re reading this, I’d welcome your feedback!</p>
            <p><strong>How I Think</strong></p>

            <p>Explore</p>
            <p>Definition: Go and see for yourself</p>
            <p>Quote: I'm not interested in whether the glass is half empty or half full. I'm interested in figuring out how to fill the glass.</p>

            <p>Evolve</p>
            <p>Definition: Relentless improvement</p>

            <p><strong>How I Act</strong></p>

            <p>1. Wartime CEO</p>
            <p>Definition: Hyper-rational, solutions oriented</p>
            <p>Strength: Steady hand in a crisis</p>
            <p>Weakness: Default to binary thinking</p>

            <p>2. Coach</p>
            <p>Definition: Empathetic and motivational, teaching oriented</p>
            <p>Strength: Teambuilding</p>
            <p>Weakness: Not everyone wants or needs coaching!</p>

            <p>3. Victim</p>
            <p>Definition: Why is this happening to me, self-pity oriented</p>
            <p>Strength: Root cause analysis</p>
            <p>Weakness: Complaining and dropping baggage on others</p>

            <p>4. Kid</p>
            <p>Definition: Fun "big kid" playing with daughters, escape oriented</p>
            <p>Strength: Fun</p>
            <p>Weakness: Goes too far with teasing</p>
            <p>The TL;DR summary here is that I like building systems that tell the truth. In organizations, in relationships, in crisis, in…pretty much anything. When we have <em>the truth</em> we can make better decisions to continuously improve that system.</p>
            <p><strong>How I Communicate</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>When sending - direct, blunt, to the point verbally and written. "Can I be wildly candid with you?"</li>
                <li>When receiving - prefer the same, little patience for long winded, spin, or dishonesty. "Get to the point!"</li>
                <li>With feedback - just hit me as hard as you can, in as close to real-time as you can. "Don't pull your punches!"</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>How I Communicate…Tactically</strong></p>

            <p>Urgency</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Urgent - call me direct and we'll problem solve</li>
                <li>Non-urgent - send me a memo or a voice memo with a time you want an answer</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Mediums</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Meetings - please no more meetings! If we have to, keep it organized and useful (everyone rates it a 10/10)</li>
                <li>Messages (email, Telegram, Slack) - please tag me if you need urgent answer, otherwise I batch at EoD</li>
                <li>Documents - use a classic memo format, I do heavily judge the quality of your memos and emails</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Quirks, Peeves, and Triggers</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>I am extremely fidget-y (I can't work sitting down) and bite my nails when I'm feeling anxious</li>
                <li>I hate when documents have margins greater than .1 inches! Wasting space!</li>
                <li>It drives me nuts when people don't have agendas for meetings and can't manage the clock</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Surprising Facts</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>I can do extroverted work well, but I'm actually an introvert and prefer alone time to read, think, write, etc</li>
                <li>I can't wrap up my day and sleep soundly without inbox zero, no unread messages, a plan for tomorrow, etc</li>
                <li>I have a monthly newsletter for family and friends <em>instead of</em> using social media to stay in touch</li>
            </ul>
